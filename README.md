# Brain Segmentation Using Supervised ML

This project implements various machine learning methods to perform brain segmentation on a dataset of brain images and their corresponding segmentation maps. Brain segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, as it involves partitioning a brain image into different regions or structures, such as gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid.

## Introduction

Brain segmentation plays a crucial role in various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and neuroscientific research. Traditional methods often require manual intervention and are time-consuming. This project aims to automate the segmentation process using machine learning techniques, thereby reducing the workload of medical professionals and potentially improving accuracy.
**Note: This project is currently a work in progress. While some initial implementations and experiments have been completed, there are ongoing efforts to further refine the methods, improve performance, and add additional features.**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images along with their corresponding segmentation maps. Each MRI image is paired with a segmentation map that labels different brain structures or regions. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## Methods

Several machine learning methods will be implemented and evaluated for brain segmentation. Currently, one has been done.

- **U-Net**: U-Net is a popular architecture for biomedical image segmentation, known for its symmetric encoder-decoder structure and skip connections.
